Statement of Interest:
“The Art of the Dynasty” is a generative art visualizer that captures the beauty of the sport of baseball created by the 2014 World Champion San Francisco Giants team. See the entire season as a piece of art and be able to interact through various data points and statistics. This represents numerous levels of completion from single games to series to season and beyond when they ultimately win their third world series.

Project Overview:
Creating a data visualization of the San Francisco Giants season using D3.js for the audience to see and interact with various variables like the season over time, individual data points like different statistics and game information in a way that is both informational as well as visually impactful.

Directions:
Open the landing page and choose between any three of the seasons shown. The visualization will automatically animate on screen. Use the scrollbar to slide between each game data point and see just what the San Francisco Giants season is composed of across the graph.
